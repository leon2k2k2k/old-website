        Hi! I am a third-year Harvard math graduate student. My advisor is Mike Hopkins.
        Before grad school, I did my undergraduate at UT Austin with Dan Freed.
        <!-- Besides math,
        I love playing sports (basketball, ping pong, and tennis), dancing (social and ballroom), and guitar (mostly
        fingerpicking). Feel free to reach out! -->
    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p> I write both math and physics papers, mostly in between. 
        My primary research interest is mathematical physics, mostly field theories and anomalies. 
        Mathematically, I am also interested in knot homologies and homotopy theory.
        Besides math and physics, I am also interested in CS (DevOps,  kubernetes, type theory and functional programming
        languages).</p>

        <li> The Hecke algebras for all symmetric groups taken together form a braided
            monoidal category that controls all quantum link invariants of type A and, by
            extension, the standard canon of topological quantum field theories in
            dimension 3 and 4. Here we provide the first categorification of this Hecke
            braided monoidal category, which takes the form of an $\mathbb{E}_2$-monoidal
            $(\infty,2)$-category whose hom-$(\infty,1)$-categories are $k$-linear, stable,
            idempotent-complete, and equipped with $\mathbb{Z}$-actions. This
            categorification is designed to control homotopy-coherent link homology
            theories and to-be-constructed topological quantum field theories in dimension
            4 and 5.
              Our construction is based on chain complexes of Soergel bimodules, with
            monoidal structure given by parabolic induction and braiding implemented by
            Rouquier complexes, all modelled homotopy-coherently. This is part of a
            framework which allows to transfer the toolkit of the categorification
            literature into the realm of $\infty$-categories and higher algebra. Along the
            way, we develop families of factorization systems for $(\infty,n)$-categories,
            enriched $\infty$-categories, and $\infty$-operads, which may be of independent
            interest.
              As a service aimed at readers less familiar with homotopy-coherent
            mathematics, we include a brief introduction to the necessary
            $\infty$-categorical technology in the form of an appendix.

<div class="content">
    <ul>
        <li>     In this note, we study $\U(n)$ Soergel bimodules in the context of stable homotopy theory. We define the $(\infty, 1)$-category $\SBim_E(n)$ of $E$-valued $\U(n)$ Soergel bimodules, where $E$ is a connective $\EE_\infty$-ring spectrum, and assemble them into a monoidal locally additive $(\infty, 2)$-category $\SBim_E$. Furthermore, when $E$ has a complex orientation, we construct a braiding, i.e. an $\EE_2$-algebra structure, on the universal locally stable $(\infty, 2)$-category $\Kbloc(\SBim_E)$ associated to $\SBim_E$. Along the way, we also prove spectral analogs of standard splittings of Soergel bimodules. This is a topological generalization of much of the type $A$ Soergel bimodule theory developed in \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02956}.

                <li> In this note, we classify topological solitons of $n$-brane fields, which are
    nonlocal fields that describe $n$-dimensional extended objects. We consider a
    class of $n$-brane fields that formally define a homomorphism from the $n$-fold
    loop space $\Omega^n X_D$ of spacetime $X_D$ to a space $\mathcal{E}_n$.
    Examples of such $n$-brane fields are Wilson operators in $n$-form gauge
    theories. The solitons are singularities of the $n$-brane field, and we
    classify them using the homotopy theory of ${\mathbb{E}_n}$-algebras. We find
    that the classification of codimension ${k+1}$ topological solitons with
    ${k\geq n}$ can be understood understood using homotopy groups of
    $\mathcal{E}_n$. In particular, they are classified by
    ${\pi_{k-n}(\mathcal{E}_n)}$ when ${n>1}$ and by ${\pi_{k-n}(\mathcal{E}_n)}$
    modulo a ${\pi_{1-n}(\mathcal{E}_n)}$ action when ${n=0}$ or ${1}$. However,
    for ${n>2}$, their classification goes beyond the homotopy groups of
    $\mathcal{E}_n$ when ${k< n}$, which we explore through examples. We compare
    this classification to $n$-form $\mathcal{E}_n$ gauge theory. We then apply
    this classification and consider an ${n}$-form symmetry described by the
    abelian group ${G^{(n)}}$ that is spontaneously broken to ${H^{(n)}\subset
    G^{(n)}}$, for which the order parameter characterizing this symmetry breaking
    pattern is an ${n}$-brane field with target space ${\mathcal{E}_n =
    G^{(n)}/H^{(n)}}$. We discuss this classification in the context of many
    examples, both with and without 't Hooft anomalies.

            <li> Smith homomorphisms are maps between bordism groups that change both the dimension and the tangential structure. We give a completely general account of Smith homomorphisms, unifying the many examples in the literature. We provide three definitions of Smith homomorphisms, including as maps of Thom spectra, and show they are equivalent. Using this, we identify the cofiber of the spectrum-level Smith map and extend the Smith homomorphism to a long exact sequence of bordism groups, which is a powerful computation tool. We discuss several examples of this long exact sequence, relating them to known constructions such as Wood’s and Wall’s sequences. Furthermore, taking Anderson duals yields a long exact sequence of invertible field theories, which has a rich physical interpretation. We developed the theory in this paper with applications in mind to symmetry breaking in quantum field theory, which we study in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749">[DDK+24]</a>.

            <li> We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.
