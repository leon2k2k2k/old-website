    <p>
        Hi! I am a third-year Harvard math graduate student. My advisor is Mike Hopkins.
        Before grad school, I did my undergraduate at UT Austin with Dan Freed.
        <!-- Besides math,
        I love playing sports (basketball, ping pong, and tennis), dancing (social and ballroom), and guitar (mostly
        fingerpicking). Feel free to reach out! -->
    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p> My primary research interest is (mathematical) physics, mostly field theories and anomalies. 
        Mathematically, I am also interested in knot homologies and homotopy theory.
        Besides math and physics, I am also interested in CS (DevOps,  kubernetes, type theory and functional programming
        languages).</p>

            <li> We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs.

We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is the Smith homomorphism, a family of maps between twisted bordism groups.

We lift it to a map of Thom spectra and identify the cofiber, producing a long exact sequence of twisted bordism groups; the SBLES is the Anderson dual of that long exact sequence.

                <li> In this note, we classify topological solitons of $n$-brane fields, which are
    nonlocal fields that describe $n$-dimensional extended objects. We consider a
    class of $n$-brane fields that formally define a homomorphism from the $n$-fold
    loop space $\Omega^n X_D$ of spacetime $X_D$ to a space $\mathcal{E}_n$.
    Examples of such $n$-brane fields are Wilson operators in $n$-form gauge
    theories. The solitons are singularities of the $n$-brane field, and we
    classify them using the homotopy theory of ${\mathbb{E}_n}$-algebras. We find
    that the classification of codimension ${k+1}$ topological solitons with
    ${k\geq n}$ can be understood understood using homotopy groups of
    $\mathcal{E}_n$. In particular, they are classified by
    ${\pi_{k-n}(\mathcal{E}_n)}$ when ${n>1}$ and by ${\pi_{k-n}(\mathcal{E}_n)}$
    modulo a ${\pi_{1-n}(\mathcal{E}_n)}$ action when ${n=0}$ or ${1}$. However,
    for ${n>2}$, their classification goes beyond the homotopy groups of
    $\mathcal{E}_n$ when ${k< n}$, which we explore through examples. We compare
    this classification to $n$-form $\mathcal{E}_n$ gauge theory. We then apply
    this classification and consider an ${n}$-form symmetry described by the
    abelian group ${G^{(n)}}$ that is spontaneously broken to ${H^{(n)}\subset
    G^{(n)}}$, for which the order parameter characterizing this symmetry breaking
    pattern is an ${n}$-brane field with target space ${\mathcal{E}_n =
    G^{(n)}/H^{(n)}}$. We discuss this classification in the context of many
    examples, both with and without 't Hooft anomalies.
